# Release Notes: WIA/CID Core Pulse – Phase 1

**Release Date:** 5/2/2025  
**Version:** v1.0.0 – Core Pulse

---

## 🚀 Overview

This release marks the completion of **Phase 1** of the WIA/CID system — a modular, multi-agent predictive reasoning framework designed to simulate and evaluate the behavior of adversarial and cooperative agents in decentralized systems.

The project includes a fully deployed smart contract, CLI-based agent SDK, entropy drift detection, and a real-time audit logging infrastructure.

## ✅ Key Features Delivered

### 🔐 Smart Contract System

- **PredictionValidation.sol** deployed to Sepolia
- Supports `submitPrediction()` and `resolvePrediction()` logic
- Tracks agent-submitted predictions with confidence and expiry
- Event-based design (PredictionSubmitted, PredictionResolved)

### 🤖 Modular Agent SDK

- CLI-driven agent runner: `node agents/run.js --persona Obfuscator`
- Agent personas implemented:
  - **Obfuscator**: vague predictions with randomized confidence
  - **Contrarian**: logically opposing prediction mimicry
  - **Overconfident**: always high-confidence predictions
  - **EntropyBomber**: high-frequency noise flooder
- Fully structured SDK (`agents/cid/`, `agents/utils/`)

### 🧠 Drift + Entropy Analysis

- `driftDetector_v2.js`: entropy tracking over time
- Confidence buckets + Shannon entropy calculation
- Persistent `drift_history.json` log

### 📜 Event Logging + Audit

- Real-time event capture via `logToJson.js` from `EventPoller.js`
- Creates append-only `audit_log.json`
- IPFS-compatible and persistent
- Ready for external indexers or visual dashboards

### 🔧 Dev Tools

- `resolvePrediction.js` CLI for resolving outcomes
- `.env`-based secure config for private keys and RPC URL
- Python Prediction Agent script (optional test agent)

## 🔮 Roadmap Highlights (Post v1.0)

### Planned Phase 2 Deliverables:

- `resolutionAnalyzer.js` (accuracy tracking)
- `agentTrustScorer.js` (reputation model)
- `entropyRadar.js` (drift visualization)
- `thresholdWatcher.js` (alerting on system deviation)
- `logToIPFS.js` (decentralized audit anchoring)
- `LLMInsightAgent.js` (semantic anomaly reflection)
- Discord integration as a socio-agentic interface
