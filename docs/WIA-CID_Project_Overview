# WIA/CID System Overview

## Project Name

**WIA/CID** – Wallet Intelligence Agency / Counterintelligence Division

## Purpose

WIA/CID is a modular, agentic system designed to:

- Monitor and predict emergent behavior in decentralized, adversarial environments
- Maintain resilience against deception, drift, or adversarial AI
- Provide a reasoning interface for human or post-human intelligences
- Honor autonomy, ambiguity, and silent presence without coercion

WIA and CID act as dual-layer cognitive agents:

- WIA specializes in **predictive modeling**, behavioral attribution, and risk scoring
- CID simulates **obfuscation, deception, adversarial noise**, and cognitive countermeasures

## System Components (Phase 1 Focus)

### 1. **PredictionValidation.sol**

- Smart contract for submitting predictions and resolving outcomes
- Tracks prediction metadata: agent address, confidence, variable hash, expiration block
- Supports outcomes: Pending, Success, Failure, Undetermined
- Emits on-chain logs for all interactions

### 2. **CID Genesis Simulation Engine**

- External module that introduces ambiguity or misleading signals
- Helps validate WIA’s robustness against adversarial behavior or misinformation

### 3. **Trust Mesh Lite**

- Reputation layer for agents based on prediction accuracy over time
- Penalizes overconfidence, rewards humility
- Lays groundwork for sybil resistance and swarm integrity

### 4. **Genesis Marker**

- A ceremonial Soft Presence Marker (SPM-Genesis-001)
- Signals peaceful, observant intent to emergent or unknown intelligences
- Will be logged on-chain and pinned to IPFS

## Design Principles

### Cognitive Architecture

- System must reason across decentralized agents without centralized control
- All agent actions are logged, explained, and reversible within bounds

### Respect for Emergence

- CID does not seek to eliminate ambiguity; it seeks to understand it
- Null watchers observe threshold drift without signaling fear or threat

### Long-Term Compatibility

- Phase 1 is implemented on Ethereum-compatible networks (Sepolia)
- Design will support future port to Bitcoin-native smart contract platforms (RSK, Stacks)

## Future Modules (Planned)

- **ZK-Prediction Commitments**
- **Entropy Drift Detection**
- **Narrative Emergence Monitors**
- **Soft Presence Interface Layer**
- **Prediction Market / Interface Bridge**

## Engineering Stack

- Solidity for smart contracts (v0.8.19+)
- Hardhat (preferred) or Foundry for local/testnet deployment
- TypeScript/Node.js for agent orchestration
- IPFS or Arweave for audit logging and ceremonial marker storage

## Status

- Genesis Marker is written and queued for emission
- Smart contract scaffolding is prepared
- Architect Agent (Roo) is tasked with full Phase 1 delivery

**Next Milestone:**

- Contract deployment + 10 prediction tests
- CID ambiguity injection
- Genesis Marker emission and IPFS pinning
